### 1. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful and what is the significance of this example in the context of complexity and development?

Thomas Thwaites, a student at the Royal College of Art, decided to explore how cheap, everyday items are dependent on global supply chains that are invisible to consumers by attempting to replicate and construct a toaster out of raw materials. In the end, the toaster that he spent months designing worked for only a few seconds until the wires started melting. The project revealed how difficult it is to be self-sufficient without wealth and the freedom it allows us. Connecting it to one of our previous assignments, we talked about how owning a cellphone meant also having the freedoms and privileges of having electricity and mobile service and connectivity and so on. Income and wealth gives us freedom and allows us to lead the kind of lives we consider of value.


### 2. According to Barder, how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?  How did he use the Harrod-Domar model, the Solow model, the Washington consensus and the Ajoakuta Steel works to illustrate his point (reference at least two of the above).
