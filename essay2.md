### 10/12 Essay: Read this press article on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a Chinese global infrastructure development plan. What are your thoughts, or more saliently, what questions do you have or what would you want to know/learn more about? What responsibilities do you think the international community should have on such matters?

The Wall Street Journal article “Hidden Debt Plagues China’s Belt and Road Infrastructure Plan, Studies Find,” discusses a Chinese project to fund transportation infrastructure across developing countries. However, research on these Chinese projects abroad points to other major issues such as corruption, labor violations, and environmental risks. Hidden debt plagues China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The article states that in their deep dive into the Belt and Road projects, AidData, a research center at William and Mary, found 42 low- and middle-income countries that have debt exposure to China exceeding 10% of their annual gross domestic product. To me, it seems that China’s program is exploitative and manipulative especially towards developing countries. Something I would want to know is how the countries involved in the BRI are impacted by these loans and if they are even beneficial. I also wonder how these lower income countries would pay back the loans. How can China afford to take such a big risk with 42 countries taking loans? I believe that it is the international community’s responsibility to hold China and other foreign lenders accountable for the impacts it has on developing countries' debts. The international community should focus on the cultivation of economic and social equality. In order to loosen China’s grip on developing countries, other countries should help in financing the development of infrastructure as this development not only benefits China and the developing countries, but also increases infrastructure globally.
