### 11/4 Essay: We have five reading/watching slots left on our schedule. I'm looking to replace one that's there now I think is on the weaker side (Thursday 11/18) and I want your help. What topic haven't we discussed (or will discuss) within the realm of data science and/or human development that you would like covered and discussed in class? Is there a particular video or reading you are aware of that you like or think is valuable that you want the rest of the class to see/read? Briefly explain your thoughts and provide a link, if applicable. 

I would love to learn how data science is being used currently to fight a pandemic and prevent future ones. Today, humanity is confronted with one of the greatest public health challenges. Although the pandemic has slowed down, over the coming years, the world must get used to living with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. With data science we can keep track of how and where Covid-19 is spreading with contact tracing, who is most at risk, who is immune, and how we can prevent future pandemics. I would like to see how data science technologies are assisting medical science and reaching milestones in drug-discovery, medical imaging, genetics and genomics, and preventive medicine. Here are a few articles and a video I found on data science during the pandemic.
