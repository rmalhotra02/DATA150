### Abstract:

Poverty is one of the most urgent concerns regarding human development forcing millions to live in negative conditions such as homelessness, food insecurity, inadequate nutrition, inadequate childcare, lack of access to healthcare or education, which all adversely impact our nations, specifically Sub-Saharan Africa and India. Due to long term effects of war, genocide, famine, and land availability and rapid population growth, Africa and India continues to rise in poverty rates. But where exactly are these impoverished zones and how can we help them? This presentation will address two different data science methods used to assess poverty and accurately locate poverty-stricken areas, allowing researchers to map poverty at a higher scale and resolution and helping countries continue to reduce poverty.
